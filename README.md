# Time

This is a little proof of concept of a split-flap display in vanilla Javascript. The current iteration displays the time in a 24 hour format, but it's not out of the question to adapt this to display anything. Just as long as it fits into one-symbol chunks. Or it can be further adapter to fit multi-letter sequences.
